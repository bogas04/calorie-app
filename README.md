# üçΩ calow

Intuitive minimalist calorie logging web app.

## Build instructions

```bash
# start app in development mode
npm run start

# build statically generated app for github pages
npm run build
```

## Technology

We use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) along with [chakra-ui](https://chakra-ui.com) and [typescript](https://typescriptlang.org). We make use of Next.js' [static site generation](https://nextjs.org/docs/advanced-features/static-html-export) to serve the app on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/).

## Motivation

Calorie counting can be difficult if you're not having complete portions. Plus, checking calories of each item for non-standard weights can be tricky. This app tries to reduce that and make it fun to calorie count.
